      <p>
        I am a software engineer with a passion for building impactful applications, who has recently graduated from a <span className="text-white">Double Bachelor's of Commerce and Computer Science</span> at <span className="text-white">UNSW</span>.
        My expertise and excitement comes from design-heavy full-stack development, thriving in collaborative and innovative environments.

        <br />
        <br />
        Being a Software Engineering Graduate at <span className="text-white">Westpac</span>, I focus on building scalable full-stack applications and internal tools that improve banking workflows. My work spans backend development in Java and Spring Boot, frontend interfaces using React and TypeScript, and CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and Artifactory.
        
        <br />
        <br />
        I've worked across a range of environments — from a client-focused <span className="text-white">tech sales</span> role, to <span className="text-white">enterprise accounting and financial audits</span> in a <span className="text-white">Big 4 Accounting Firm</span>, and now <span className="text-white">data migration</span> using Oracle-based ETL tools and <span className="text-white">end-to-end full stack applications</span> at a <span className="text-white">Big 4 Bank</span>. I also enjoy building personal projects for real users — tools that proliferate their daily lives or help them learn new skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        Whether it's backend engineering, frontend UI/UX, or DevOps automation, I thrive at the intersection of performance, simplicity, and reliability.
